# BTCSteamer
This program will create a GUI that runs in the background and allows you to ticker-stream live crypto currency prices as well as customize views and data.

This program is being created while watching the Sentdex tutorials online, so much of the credit goes to Harrison. But I welcome any feedback or input as I go. I am very new to Python, and am largely using this app to learn its functionality. My goal is to eventually create an app that can live-stream current prices for BTC, LTC, and Ether, calculate exchange rates, set alerts, and possibly even recommend trades based on certain strategies.
